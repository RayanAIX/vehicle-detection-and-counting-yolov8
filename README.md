# 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Counting (YOLOv8)

This computer vision project detects and counts vehicles from traffic videos in real time using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV**.  
It identifies cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks, displays the count per frame, and saves an annotated output video.  
This system can be used for traffic monitoring, smart city projects, and transportation research.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load the **YOLOv8 pre-trained model** (`yolov8n.pt` for speed or `yolov8s.pt` for higher accuracy)
2. Process video frames using **OpenCV**
3. Run YOLOv8 object detection on each frame
4. Filter detections for **vehicle classes**: car, motorcycle, bus, truck
5. Draw **bounding boxes** and labels with confidence scores
6. Count vehicles in the current frame
7. Overlay the vehicle count onto the frame
8. Save the processed frames into an **output video file**

🔭 Future Enhancements

Lane-wise counting using virtual lines/regions of interest (ROI)

Speed estimation using pixel-to-meter calibration and FPS

Real-time CCTV/IP camera stream integration

Dashboard/analytics for live traffic monitoring

Train YOLOv8 on a custom dataset for improved class coverage (e.g., rickshaw, bicycle)
